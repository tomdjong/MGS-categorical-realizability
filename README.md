#### Abstract

*Realizability, as invented by Kleene, is a technique for elucidating the
computational content of mathematical proofs. In this course we study
realizability from a categorical perspective. Starting from an abstract and
general model of computation known as a partial combinatory algebra (pca), we
construct the category of assemblies over it. Intuitively, an assembly is a set
together with computability data and an assembly map is a function of sets that
is computable. Here, the notion of computability is prescribed by the
pca. Through the framework of categorical logic, the assemblies give rise to the
realizability interpretation of logic, which we spell out in detail.*

*The central theme of this course is the interplay between category theory,
logic and computability theory. While some familiarity with basic category
theory (e.g. (co)limits and adjunctions) is required for some parts of the
notes, the course hopefully offers plenty to those unfamiliar with category
theory.*
